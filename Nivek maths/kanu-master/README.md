Kanu is a CLI application that can solve linear equations, and simplify algebraic expressions. I built this because
I thought it would be a fun challenge to make a working calculator. Kanu is still a work in progress, and will only
become smarter and more effective over time. Kanu is written entirely in Python.

### Using Kanu

To use this wonderful application for yourself, simply download the project onto your computer. To properly
run Kanu, you must have python3 installed. From the terminal, run:
```python
python3 kanu.py
```
I'm always looking to improve the Kanu, so if you break it, please email me with the case that crashed the program
and I will do my best to fix it.

### Examples
Currently, Kanu can solve linear equations and simplify algebraic expressions. When you first run the program, you
will be prompted to select one of two options: solve a linear equation, or simplify an algebraic expression.
